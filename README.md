On hold project that would be presented as a final project to the Algorithms and Data Structure course.

The idea was to implement in C++ a system that could read and store basic registrations in binary and CSV structures and be able to search, confirm and edit previous registrations. 
As the assignment has been suspended, the project is on hold until further study/hobby willingness.
